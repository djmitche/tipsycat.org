The [Albany Brew Crafters](http://albanybrewcrafters.com) is running a Barrel project.
In the first brew in the project, several brewers made a Russian Imperial Stout that aged for about six months.
I've only had a sip, but it was delicious.

After this brew, the barrel project landed in my lap.
As did the barrel:

The antics and drama with this barrel have been many, and I'll share more stories later, but one particular story is important enough to call out on its own, as a public service.

Barrels need to be kept wet, so the wood swells and is watertight.
But when empty, a wet barrel is fertile ground for mold and bacteria.
The typical solution is to flood the barrel with SO<sub>2</sub>, which inhibits this growth.
Wineries and large breweries do this with a magic wand that can inject SO<sub>2</sub> from a tank.

For smaller operations, there are [sulfur wicks](http://www.homebrewwest.ie/sulphur-wicks-german-10-pieces-1756-p.asp) which can be burned to produce SO<sub>2</sub>.
The Internet is rife with warnings that burning a wick in a barrel full of alcohol vapors is explosive.
There are also warnings that if the wick falls into a wet spot on the barrel it will produce sulfurous acid which must then be neutralized through an alkaline rinse followed by a citric acid rinse.
But I cannot find one warning about the dangers of inhaling SO<sub>2</sub>.

After cleaning and drying our barrel, I returned to the brewery to burn a sulfur stick.
I rolled the barrel outside for adequate ventilation, but in the slight breeze had trouble getting matches to stay lit.
After a few tries I saw some darkening of the sulfur stick, but in the bright sunlight I couldn't tell if it was burning.
I leaned in for a closer look, and got a lungful of SO<sub>2</sub>.
My throat burned, and I coughed quite a lot.

The [MSDS](http://avogadro.chem.iastate.edu/msds/sulfur_dioxide.pdf) for Sulfur Dioxide is not a pleasant read just moments after having inhaled it.
The stuff is *highly* toxic, and reacts with anything wet -- such as mucous membranes or even your skin -- to produce a corrosive acid.

My cough subsided quickly, the burning in my throat was minor, and I wasn't having any trouble breathing, so I decided not to seek medical attention immediately.
The next day, though, I had a terrible headache that became a fever, so I did visit a doctor.
He wasn't able to determine whether the fever was related to the inhalation, but cleared me of the respiratory side-effects of inhalation.
Lost time from work, medical bills, and sick over a long weekend: a big price to pay for a batch of beer.

So if you haven't figured it out, the moral of the story is: **When handling a sulfur wick, take every precaution to avoid inhaling or exposing yourself to the vapors.**

In particular:

 * Burn it outside
 * Don't work alone
 * Wear impermeable gloves
 * Keep your face well clear of the wick
 * Stay upwind

P.S. In all the excitement, I dropped the half-burned wick into the barrel, as it shrinks while it burns and came loose from the wire holder I constructed.
That poor barrel may be a planter soon!
