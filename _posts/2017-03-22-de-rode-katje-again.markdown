I had a Rodenbach Grand Cru since the January batch of De Rode Katje, and was
shocked at how sweet it was.  The sour and funk were remarkably similar to
mine, but the sweet, malty aspect was completely new.

The options on the Internet for fixing this are not great: sweeten with an
Aspartame or something similar; pasteurize and backsweeten (rumor is this is
what Rodenbach does); or mix with a sweeter base beer and serve immediately.

I figured that I should try the third option before resorting to the second.  I
don't think I'd ever dump an artificial sweetener in there.

So, I made a few changes to the recipe:

 * Higher mash temp (targeting 70&deg;C)
 * Shorter mash (just until an iodine test for starch comes back negative)
 * Darker crystal malt (60 Lovibond) for more unfermentables
 * Using T-85, which has a higher final gravity than the usual US-05
 * Substituting D-54 Candi Syrup for some of the malt bill

I don't have a good excuse for the latter: its effect will be to dry the beer
out, but I'm hoping that its "malty" flavor contributions survive the
Lactobacillus and round out the flavor profile.

The plan is to take this off primary fairly quickly, once the kreusen falls,
mix it about 50/50 with the barrel batch (last cycled in January), and
immediately chill and pressurize the result to try to slow down any bacterial
fermentation of the remaining sugars.
